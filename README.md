SQL-EMPLOYEE-TRACKER

In this project I created an employee tracker that would place the individual employees in specific category's such as 
a role that they have in the company such as a CEO or working in production.
This app also shows the different departments and different salaries for each employee.

The user also has the ability to insert a different employee to the list of current employees already givin to start.
